# anki-plugins
This is a repository for scripts I write to make Anki a little easier for me. Currently it considers of one script, titled `keep-cards-tidy`, which is a series of text formatting steps that are run on my Anki deck each time I synchronize it.

By doing this I get rid of a lot of pesky formatting errors and inconsistent formatting that appears in Anki cards, particularly when you are pasting from the Internet where Anki will preserve HTML tags and CSS even if you just want the plain text.

Since I just want the plaintext when I'm getting a sample sentence from the Internet at the time of making a new card, these processing steps are very useful and they run automatically.

# Setup

To use this add-on you just have to drop the folder in the right place in your filesystem. To do this see [this page](https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net/addon-folders.html) from the AnkiWeb documentation.
